## Overview

### Screenshot

### Inspiration

As a person who is more into art, I always wondered why the majority of websites don't have a good UI despite the fact that there are people capable of doing more than that. so I tried to make a website that has a good user experience, look and feel to it.

### what is does

It has a landing page where users can see artwork and when clicking the users are redirected to a new page with detailed info about the artwork beneath that there is a feature for live chat/support where people can start a chat with random people who are also interested in artwork like them and also ask queries if they have any. every time a user enters the chat a new random user is created with a single button click and when the user leaves the website the user is destroyed making the concurrent user free for making space for new users.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live Url](https://make-url-small.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

I first started by creating react template by CRA then started making the landing page for the website and making it as clean as I can then I created another page for the art info and added a live chat/support for that page. i went ahead and make the site fully responsive and added animations to it.
